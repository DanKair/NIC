This is my first API building experience and overall first "Framework / library" using experience.
Overall it took me 25+ hours to finish this CRUD project.

Little background: Before starting (23.09.24) I had no idea what is CRUD, REST API and how to use frameworks overall. 
I always thought that I need some prerequesits to start using and learning frameworks. 
But actually this was wrong thinking, because at start I didn't knew what is OOP, asynchronous programming and other basic staff.
Btw, I was in "Tutorial Hell" for more than 1 Year.
It took me 5 hours to finally start understanding FastAPI and in that moment I finally built POST, DELETE operations.

I wanna point out that it could took much less time to finish this project if I immediately hopped on to documentation and wasn't using 4 different tutorials by juggling them.

At the end, it was my first real experience of development and problem-solving, which gave me much more knowledge and experience than my 1.5 year self-taught journey.
So, that's pretty it, thanks for NIC staff, who made this project to get nice opportunity to learn, gain real NO BS experience and knowledge!
